    <h1>My Creative Skills</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>HTML And CSS</h2>
    Having knowledge of HTML and CSS is imperative to become a web developer. HTML is the most commonly
    used markup language globally. Web developers use this language extensively to build web pages.
    I am also required to use CSS to style websites. For instance,
    I can use CSS to implement different fonts, colours and layouts in the design of a website.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    JavaScript helps me implement some complex features onto a website. Knowledge of JavaScript helps
    me meet higher expectations of my clients when creating websites. For instance, I can use this
    programming language when my clients want to store data through caches or move search bars on a webpage.
    Mastery of these skills helps me create highly interactive websites that focus on user experience.
